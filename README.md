# Avanti-West-Coast-Project

This is a group project done during the duration of my MSc in Data Science in cooperation with Avant West Coast. 

The questions we sought to address were as follows:

(1) What is the relationship between the extreme weather (flooding and high winds) and the Avanti West Coast North of Preston railway performance? What has changed in terms of performance?

(2) How does the introduction of blanket temporary speed restrictions north of Preston in response to extreme weather affect performance?

(3) What was the benefit of the emergency timetable work that took place from October 27th to October 30th, 2021, in response to weather-related temporary speed restrictions?

(4) How do we know whether and when NR should implement a weather-related emergency speed restriction?

The models used in this case are Logistic Regression and a Neural Network, with the Neural Network outperforming Logistic Regression by 16% in accuracy. The data is not publicly avalable since it was confidential.

This study focuses on the region north of Preston. The data provided contained information about operational decisions, effects of the actions taken and weather conditions.
